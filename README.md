# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project is my introduction to React where I delve into the fundamentals of React components, elements, props, and state to make a working Tic-Tac-Toe game that:
- Lets you play Tic-Tac-Toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

All the relevant code is found in App.js. Enjoy!
