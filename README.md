# TicTacToe

Welcome to my TicTacToe game! This project is my introduction to React where I delve into the fundamentals of React components, elements, props, and state to make a working TicTacToe game that:
- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

All the relevant code is found in App.js. Enjoy!
